This is a deprecated project.

This is a portfolio project designed to showcase my proficiency in full-stack web development, utilizing React for the front end and Ruby on Rails for the backend. Initially, my goal was to create a shopping web app with standard e-commerce features. Initially, the coherence of the project didn't concern me, as my primary focus was on showcasing my skills. I employed React within the ERB view files of Rails, managing React components through the asset pipeline.

However, during the project's development, I decided to enhance its structure by separating the backend and frontend. This decision was motivated by a desire to optimize the project as if it were intended for practical use. Consequently, my vision evolved into a web app with a modular front end and an API-based backend. This change reflects my commitment to creating a more scalable and efficient application.
