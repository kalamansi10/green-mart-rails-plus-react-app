# Deprecated Project - Seed Mart

**Note: This project is deprecated and no longer actively maintained.**

This portfolio project was initially designed to showcase my proficiency in full-stack web development, utilizing React for the front end and Ruby on Rails for the backend. The original goal was to create a shopping web app with standard e-commerce features. At first, the coherence of the project wasn't a priority, as the main focus was on showcasing my skills. React components were managed within the ERB view files of Rails, utilizing the asset pipeline.

However, as the project evolved, I made the decision to enhance its structure by separating the backend and frontend. This transition aimed to optimize the project for ~~practical use~~, transforming it into a web app with a modular front end and an API-based backend. This change reflects my commitment to creating a more scalable and efficient application.
